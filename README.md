Database Storage To Do List
==============
This was built using the framework of a simple to do list app that I put together utilizing local storage. This application builds off that and allows you to create an account to store your information on my server. This allows for access across all devices. I used Bootstrap to create the simple and clean design. It also utilizes the Bootstrap responsive framework to make it display properly across all screen resolutions.

Features
--------------

**Multiple Lists**

The app starts with a default list: "To Do". The title of this list is editable and you can also add as many other lists as you would like. If you delete all of the lists the default "To Do" will automatically become your default list.

**Saves Instantly**

The application data automatically saves after any changes to lists or list items. This ensures that no data is lost even if you navigate away from the page by mistake. Your data is always saved and accessible across all devices.

**Fully Responsive**

The application utilizes the responsive framework that Bootstrap provides to ensure it displays properly across all devices. On mobile devices the layout changes slightly, but all of the information and features still remain. With the data stored in a database, you can also access your lists from all of your devices, right in the browser.

Local Storage
--------------
This application was built using the framework of a To Do list application I built that stored data in the local storage of a browser. Take a look at that code, or view the application below.
